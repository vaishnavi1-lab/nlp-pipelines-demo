# 🧠 NLP Pipelines with Hugging Face Transformers

This project showcases 8 major **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks using the powerful [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library — with interactive examples built in Python.

👉 Perfect for NLP beginners, intermediate learners, or anyone building a portfolio.

---

## 🚀 Features

Each task uses a pre-trained model in a plug-and-play pipeline:

1. ✅ **Text Classification** – Detect sentiment or label content
2. ❓ **Zero-Shot Classification** – Classify without training
3. ✍️ **Text Generation** – Auto-write content from a prompt
4. 🧩 **Masked Language Modeling** – Fill in missing words
5. 🧾 **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Label people, places, etc.
6. 🔍 **Question Answering** – Extract answers from text
7. ✂️ **Summarization** – Shorten long articles or paragraphs
8. 🌐 **Translation** – Convert between languages
